## Overview

**RakeNet** is a state-of-the-art AI/ML-based Decision Support System (DSS) designed to revolutionize bulk material rake (full train-load) formation and dispatch planning in large-scale logistics operations, specifically within the **Steel Industry**.

The traditional, manual, or rule-based rake planning process leads to delays, underutilization of assets, and high demurrage costs. RakeNet addresses this by dynamically generating **optimal, cost-efficient, and resource-balanced rake plans** in real-time.

## Core Features:
- **AI-Powered Rake Planning:**  
  Uses *Google Gemini API* to analyze pending orders, inventory, and constraints to generate optimized rake formation plans.
- **Dynamic Inventory & Order Tracking:**  
  Monitors production and dispatch data from multiple steel plants.
- **Route Optimization & Live Map:**  
  Displays plant and rake locations using WebGIS (Leaflet + React).
- **Decision Support Dashboard:**  
  Tracks KPIs, order priorities, and resource allocation efficiency.
- **Reporting & Analytics:**  
  Auto-generated reports for order fulfillment and rake utilization.

## System Modules

### 1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
Provides an overview of current stock, pending orders, deadlines, and inventory levels across all bases.

### 2. **Inventory** (`/inventories`)
Displays real-time stock levels, available rakes at each plant, and historical inventory updates.

### 3. **Rake Formation Planner** (`/planner`)
Core interface for generating optimized rake formation plans using AI.  
Shows key metrics such as **Cost**, **Utilization**, and **SLA compliance**, with dispatch recommendations.

### 4. **Logistics Map** (`/logistics-map`)
Real-time **WebGIS** visualization of the logistics network, including plant locations, active routes, and in-transit rakes.

### 5. **Reports** (`/reports`)
Displays historical performance analytics, including **Order Fulfillment Reports** and **Rake Utilization** metrics.
